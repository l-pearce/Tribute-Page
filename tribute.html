      <p class="bio">Lauded by Rolling Stone as "the embodiment of rock & roll", with more than 140 million records sold
        around the
        globe and more than 70 million in the United States, Bruce Springsteen is one of the world&apos;s best-selling
        artists. Long recognized as an incomparable live performer, he has won 20 Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, two
        Golden Globes, and a Special Tony Award.</p>
      <p class="bio">In 1999, Springsteen was inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall
        of Fame. In
        2013 he received the Kennedy Center Honors, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the
        country&apos;s highest civilian award, by President Barack Obama in 2016.</p>
      <p class="bio">Before the success and accolades, the fiercely loyal New Jerseyan first assembled the E Street Band
        on beaches
        and boardwalk clubs of the state &minus; many whom still tour with him till this day. He was signed to Columbia
        Records, where he would stay for his entire career, by the legendary A&R executive John Hammond, whose other
        discoveries included Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, and Billie Holiday.</p>
      <p class="bio">Springsteen&apos;s first two records—Greetings from Asbury Park, NJ and The Wild, The Innocent, &
        the E Street
        Shuffle, both released in 1973—established his hyper-literate lyric sensibility and a sound incorporating soul,
        folk, and classic rock & roll. But it was 1975&apos;s Born to Run that made the kind of once-in-a-decade impact
        that resonates to this day; it landed him simultaneous covers of Time and Newsweek magazines and still appears
        near the top of most every list of the greatest albums of all time.</p>
      <p class="bio">The ferocious, stripped-down Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978) secured his position as a singer
        and
        songwriter of incalculable influence, and the ambitious double-album The River (1980) gave him his first Top 40
        single with “Hungry Heart.” After regrouping with the bleak home recordings on Nebraska (1982), he returned with
        the phenomenon of Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which has been certified 17-times platinum and spun off seven Top
        Ten hits</p>
      <p class="bio">Yet for all his critical and commercial success, Springsteen&apos;s albums illustrated a drive to
        explore
        different directions and challenge his audience. The next decade saw the introverted relationship document
        Tunnel of Love (1987), the E Street-less double-shot of Human Touch and Lucky Town (1992), and the parched,
        acoustic The Ghost of Tom Joad (1995).</p>
      <p class="bio">In 1999, after ten years apart, Springsteen reconvened the E Street Band for a historic series of
        shows
        documented on the Live in New York City album. In 2002 came The Rising, an attempt to make sense of 9/11, but
        then he changed course again with the intimate narratives of Devils & Dust (2005) and the joyous celebration of
        American folk tradition We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (2006).</p>
      <p class="bio">Springsteen published his autobiography, Born to Run, in 2016. It rose quickly to the top of the
        New York Times Best Seller list and was named one of the best books of the year by outlets from NPR to the
        Washington Post. The book evolved into the one-man show Springsteen on Broadway, which—after being extended
        three times—ran for 236 performances at the Walter Kerr Theatre. (Following the pandemic lockdown, it was the
        first show to re-open Broadway, for a 31-show revival in 2021.)</p>
      <p class="bio">Since the E Street Reunion tour, Springsteen has toured consistently, usually with the band but
        sometimes in other configurations. Highlights have included the 2004 Vote for Change benefit tour; The Rising
        Tour (2002), with a record-breaking ten nights at Giants Stadium; and the Wrecking Ball World Tour (2012) and
        The River Tour (2016), both of which were the highest-grossing tours of their respective years. According to
        Pollstar magazine, Springsteen is one of just four artists who have sold more than 20 million tickets since
        1980.</p>
